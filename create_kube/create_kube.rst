Creating a Kubernetes Cluster
-----------------------------

Overview
++++++++

Before we can deploy an application using kubernetes we need to create a Kubernetes cluster first. The cluster that we are ging to create consists out of the following VMs:

- 1 Master node (VM)
- 3 Worker node (VMs)
- 3 etcd nodes (VMs)

.. note:: For more information on the terms master, worker and etcd, please look at https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/.


Creating a Cluster
++++++++++++++++++

In your PRISM Central, select the three dash in the top left corner and select **Service -> Karbon**.

In the shown browser screen click on the **+ Create Cluster** button for starting to create the kubernetes cluster.

Provide the required parameters that are asked for in the wizard. The following screenshots can be used as a guideline. 

.. note:: Where there needs to be more information to explain the settings, it will be provided in notes. You can also hoover over the **?** sign to get more information.

Provide the Network Provider settings.

.. note:: We use flannel as the network provider. More information on Flannel can be found here: https://github.com/coreos/flannel#flannel

Provide the Storage class settings. For the cluster settings use **admin** and the **corresponding password** that you used to login to the cluster.

|

Click on the **Create** button to have the cluster created by the system. Follow the process in the Karbon UI.

.. note:: 
  Based on the resources available on your cluster, it will take time. 
  **Wait until the cluster has been created before proceeding to the next part of the module!!**

During the creation of the Kubernetes cluster there will have been created:

- VMs

- Persistent Storage as VolumeGroup

Cluster properties
++++++++++++++++++

In the Karbon UI, hoover over the just created cluster (wordpress in our example) and click on it.

This will open another screen which shows the parts out of which the cluster is created according to the provided parameters that have been provided during the creation phase.

The below screenshots provide an example for the three parts, Storage Class, Volume and Add-on.
